                <h2>About Us – LABx</h2>
                <p>We envision an arts ecology that embraces collectivity and interdependence. We envision
                    organizations that are guided by community input, leadership, and respond to community
                    needs. We envision an industry that regularly calls upon the strength of artists and creative
                    thinkers to engage in creative processes to discover solutions to organizational and
                    structural challenges. We envision a people-centred field that embraces change, and
                    understands its relationship to the land on which it stands and the communities of which it
                    is part.</p>
                <h3>Our Values</h3>

                    <li>Land as a practical grounding for the work and for connection to community</li>

                    <h3>Governance Re-imagining/Restructuring</h3>
                    <p>The non-profit governance system is flawed. It disempowers the arts workers at the centre
                        of an organization and the community to which they are accountable.</p>
                    <p>We offer processes and alternative models of practicing collaborative governance that
                        identifies the various areas of need and finds a structure and decision-making process that
                        addresses those needs. This is done with the goal of investing the power in the community
                        and the arts workers of the organization.</p>
                    <p>Our process calls in a broad network of supporters and community members and generates
                        practices that enables governance to tap expert and experiential knowledge from those
                        with the deepest connections to the core work and programming of the organization. We
                        also help to account for the legal and administrative requirements to comply with
                        provincial and federal non-profit and charitable laws.</p>

                    <h3>Establishing a Strong Vision and Values</h3>
                    <p>Your organization’s vision and values guide everything you do, and more importantly how
                        you do it. Strong and well-articulated values can determine your personnel’s ability to
                        collaborate, sustain open communication, and enable self-guidance in your operations.</p>
                    <p>We facilitate a multi-phase process that involves extensive research within the community
                        of your organization. We help you find clarity on your context, establish the core vision and
                        values, and then identify the manifestation of those values through your operating
                        structures, governance, community relationships, leadership structure, and programming.
                        We understand that values are not a static thing, but a practice that must be present in the
                        day-to-day functioning and we offer sustained facilitation that gives time and space for the
                        experiential practice of operating from your values.</p>

                    <h3>Leadership searches, job calls, sustained staff coaching</h3>
                    <p>The current multi-faceted crisis in the arts is making many arts organizations re-examine
                        their leadership and staffing models, looking to address the systemic racism embedded in
                        their operations. In many cases, this examination is coinciding with a leadership transition.
                        In the search for new staff and leaders, conscious care must be taken to communicate and
                        circulate the calls in ways that encourage candidates who might not have traditionally seen
                        themselves in the role. It is then crucial that these candidates have the necessary supports
                        within the organization to succeed in their new role.</p>
                    <p>When we work with your organization we help you identify the challenges of current
                        staffing or leadership models, facilitate the necessary changes, and then help craft a job call
                        that reflects the new paradigm. We put extensive consideration into the community
                        circulation of the job call and host community info sessions to encourage a wide range of
                        applications. We know that community accountability is crucial for all levels of hirings at
                        arts organizations and we strive to create a hiring process that reflects broad community
                        support through the process. When a new staff member or leader is in place, we can
                        provide sustained support and coaching as the new hire navigates the organization and the
                        role.</p>
